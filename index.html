          <h3>A text is a sequence of words. A text stays the same no matter how iit's rendered. Consider the sentence "I like pizza." I can print that text on a piece of paper, or read it aloud, or sve it in a file on my laptop. It'll be the same text, just rendered different ways-visually, audibly digitally.</h3>
          <h3>But when "I like pizza" is printed, typography gets involved. All visually displayed text involves typography - whether it's on paper, a computer screen, or a billboard.</h3>
          <h3>Is typography a art? That's like asking if photography is an art. Some photographers and typographers use techniques that raise their work to the level of art. But at their core, both photography and typography have a utilitarian function. The aesthetic component is seperate. Being an effective typographer is more about good skills that good taste. And you can learn the skills. </h3>
